# The Wiki Game

The Wiki Game is a Wikipedia navigation game where the goal is to navigate from a starting article to a target article by following internal links. Unlike traditional algorithmic wiki games, this implementation uses semantic similarity and a pre-trained language model to best select the next article.

**Disclaimer:** Other implementations using semantic similarity exist, but this project emphasizes brevity, efficiency, and achieving a low turn count.
